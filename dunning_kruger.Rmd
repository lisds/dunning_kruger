# Exploring the Dunning-Kruger effect

Here we load the libraries we need:

```{python}
import numpy as np
rng = np.random.default_rng()
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
np.set_printoptions(suppress=True)
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
```

In this notebook we are investigating whether the Dunning-Kruger effect can be explained with simple statistical artifacts.

An example of random choice.

```{python}
a = rng.choice([1, 2], p=[0.3, 0.7], size=10)
a
```

Make some actual scores.

```{python}
# Actual scores from some test.  Mean 50, std 15.
actual_scores = rng.normal(50, 15, size=10_000)
actual_scores[:10]
```

```{python}
plt.hist(actual_scores, bins=100);
```

```{python}
# Actually, I'm more interested in percentiles.  Let's order the scores.
sorted_actual = np.sort(actual_scores)
sorted_actual
```

```{python}
# Oh wait, it doesn't actually matter what the scores are, it just depends
# on their rank order.   I can just use linspace for that.
percentile_actual = np.linspace(0, 100, 10_000)
percentile_actual
```

```{python}
# Scale so range is 10 to 110 taking in the BTA effect +10.
x = percentile_actual + 10


# Creating a function that limits the maximum values to be 100, since if someone has 95 but thinks is better than what he really is - he can only put in 100 as a higher value.
def max_100(x):
    # Using list comprehension to create a new list with capped values
    result = [min(a, 100) for a in x]
    return result

crushed_bta =  max_100(x) #this means you don't need to play around with any actually crushing you just shift the higher values onto a single value, no need for any strange rules; you just end up with more people that believe they are experts even though they aren't.
np.mean(crushed_bta)
```

```{python}
plt.hist(crushed_bta, bins=100)
```

```{python}
perceived_minus_actual = crushed_bta - percentile_actual
perceived_minus_actual
```

```{python}
plt.hist(perceived_minus_actual)
```

```{python}
plt.plot(perceived_minus_actual)
```

```{python}
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'actual_percentile': percentile_actual,
    'perceived_percentile': crushed_bta,
    'difference': crushed_bta - percentile_actual
})
df
```

```{python}
df['actual_quantile'] = pd.qcut(df['actual_percentile'], 4,
                                labels=['low', 'med-low', 'med-high', 'high'])
df
```

```{python}
df.groupby('actual_quantile', observed=True)['difference'].mean()
```

```{python}
# add some randomness to perceived percentiles
df['perceived_percentile_w_randomness'] = df['perceived_percentile'] + rng.normal(0, 10, len(df))

# calculate the difference between the new perceived percentiles (with randomness) and the actual percentiles
df['difference_w_randomness'] = df['perceived_percentile_w_randomness'] - df['actual_percentile']

df.head()
```
